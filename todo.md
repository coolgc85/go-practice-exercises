# Go Study Plan

## Completed Topics
- ~~Introduction to Go~~
- ~~Environment Setup (Go Modules)~~
- ~~Basic Syntax (variables, types, constants)~~
- ~~Control Flow (if/else, for)~~
- ~~Functions (multiple returns)~~
- ~~Packages & Imports~~
- ~~Error Handling (error returns)~~
- ~~Basic I/O (Console I/O)~~

## To-Do
Here are the topics from the initial study list that are not yet covered in this project.

- [ ] **Control Flow: `switch` statement**
  - Create a new exercise that demonstrates the use of a `switch` statement.

- [ ] **Concurrency**
  - **Goroutines**: Create an exercise that uses the `go` keyword to start a simple goroutine.
  - **sync.WaitGroup**: Extend the goroutine exercise to use a `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for the goroutine to finish.

- [ ] **Resource Management: `defer` keyword**
  - Create an exercise that demonstrates the `defer` keyword, perhaps for closing a resource or printing a message at the end of a function.

- [ ] **Basic I/O: File I/O**
  - Create an exercise that reads from or writes to a file using the `os` package.
